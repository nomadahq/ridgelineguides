      <h1>California Real Estate License Renewal: CE Hours, Deadline, and Costs (2026)</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">Last updated: February 2026 &middot; Applies to: California LLCs</p>

      <p>California real estate licenses are renewed every four years through the Department of Real Estate (DRE). The renewal requires 45 hours of continuing education — one of the highest CE requirements in the country. However, the four-year cycle means you have more time to complete it.</p>

      <h2>When is it due?</h2>
      <p>Your California real estate license expires <strong>4 years from the date of issuance</strong>. DRE sends renewal notices approximately 60 days before expiration. You can renew up to 90 days before your expiration date.</p>

      <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
      <p>Renewal fees are $245 for salespersons and $300 for brokers. CE course costs are separate, typically $100–$300 for all 45 hours.</p>

      <h2>What happens if you miss the deadline?</h2>
      <p>If your license expires, you have 2 years to renew late. During this late period, you cannot practice. You may be able to renew with reduced CE requirements. After 2 years of expiration, you must re-apply and pass the exam again.</p>

      <h2>Do you need a registered agent in California?</h2>
      <p><strong>CE Requirements:</strong> California requires 45 hours of CE per 4-year renewal cycle, including mandatory courses in: agency, ethics, trust fund handling, fair housing, risk management, management and supervision, and other required topics. Check the DRE website for the specific course list required for your renewal cycle.</p>

      <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
      <h3>Why does California require 45 hours of CE?</h3>
      <p>California has one of the highest CE requirements because its 4-year renewal cycle is longer than the 2-year cycle in most states. Spread over 4 years, it averages about 11 hours per year.</p>

      <h3>Can I take courses online?</h3>
      <p>Yes. California DRE approves many online CE providers including Allied Schools, The CE Shop, Kaplan, and others.</p>

      <h3>What if I just want to keep my license on inactive status?</h3>
      <p>You can renew on inactive status with no CE requirement, but you cannot practice until you complete CE and reactivate. This can be useful if you want to keep your license but are not actively working in real estate.</p>
