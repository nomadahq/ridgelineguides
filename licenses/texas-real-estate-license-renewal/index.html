      <h1>Texas Real Estate License Renewal: CE Hours, Deadline, and Costs (2026)</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">Last updated: February 2026 &middot; Applies to: Texas LLCs</p>

      <p>Texas real estate licenses must be renewed every two years through the Texas Real Estate Commission (TREC). Renewal requires completing continuing education (CE) hours and paying the renewal fee. If you miss your deadline, you can still renew late within 6 months with an additional fee. After 6 months, you must retake the licensing exam.</p>

      <h2>When is it due?</h2>
      <p>Your Texas real estate license renewal is due by your <strong>individual license expiration date</strong>, which is every two years from your original issuance or last renewal. TREC sends email reminders before the deadline. You can renew up to 90 days before expiration.</p>

      <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
      <p>Renewal fees are $110 for active sales agents and $330 for brokers. These fees are paid directly to TREC during online renewal. CE course costs are separate and vary by provider — typically $50–$200 for all required hours.</p>

      </div>

      <h2>What happens if you miss the deadline?</h2>
      <p>If you miss your expiration date, you have a 6-month grace period to renew late with additional fees. After 6 months of expiration, your license enters an inactive status and you must satisfy additional requirements including potentially retaking the state exam to reactivate.</p>

      <h2>Do you need a registered agent in Texas?</h2>
      <p><strong>CE Requirements:</strong> Texas requires 18 hours of CE for each renewal cycle, including: 4 hours of Legal Update I, 4 hours of Legal Update II, and 10 hours of elective CE from TREC-approved providers. First-time renewals (after the first license period) require the full SAE course requirements — check TREC for details.</p>
