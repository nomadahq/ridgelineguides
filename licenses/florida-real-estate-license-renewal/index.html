      <p class="article-meta">Last updated: February 2026 &middot; Applies to: Florida LLCs</p>

      <p>Florida real estate licenses are renewed every two years through the Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR). The renewal requires completing 14 hours of continuing education and paying the renewal fee. Florida has one of the lower renewal fees in the country.</p>

      <h2>When is it due?</h2>
      <p>Florida real estate licenses expire either on <strong>March 31 or September 30</strong> of the renewal year, depending on when you were originally licensed. Renewal opens 90 days before expiration. DBPR sends email reminders.</p>

      <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
      <p>Renewal fees are $32 for sales associates and $36 for brokers, paid to DBPR during online renewal. CE course costs are separate — typically $30–$100 for all required hours.</p>

      <h2>What happens if you miss the deadline?</h2>
      <p>If your license expires, you have 12 months to renew late. During this period, you cannot practice. Late renewal requires additional CE hours and fees. After 12 months, your license becomes null and you must re-apply and pass the exam again.</p>

      <h2>Do you need a registered agent in Florida?</h2>
      <p><strong>CE Requirements:</strong> Florida requires 14 hours of CE per renewal cycle, including: 3 hours of core law, 3 hours of ethics, and 8 hours of specialty CE from FREC-approved providers. First-time renewals require a 45-hour post-licensing course instead of standard CE.</p>
