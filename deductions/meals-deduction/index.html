      <h1>Business Meals Deduction: Current Rules and Documentation (2026)</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">Last updated: February 2026 &middot; Applies to: Self-employed individuals, freelancers, small business owners</p>

      <p>Business meals are deductible — but only partially, and only with proper documentation. The rules have changed several times in recent years, which causes confusion. As of 2026, business meals are generally 50% deductible. The temporary 100% deduction for restaurant meals expired at the end of 2022. This guide covers the current rules.</p>

      <h2>Quick summary</h2>
      <div class="info-box"><strong>Business meals are 50% deductible.</strong> The meal must have a clear business purpose, and you must document who was present, the business relationship, and what was discussed. The temporary 100% restaurant meal deduction from 2021-2022 has expired.</div>

      <h2>How the meals deduction works</h2>
      <p>When you eat a meal with a client, customer, vendor, or business associate and discuss business, you can deduct 50% of the cost. The meal does not need to be lavish or extravagant, but it must be directly related to or associated with your business. You must be present at the meal — you cannot deduct meals for clients when you are not there.</p>

      <h2>What qualifies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Meals with clients or potential clients where business is discussed</li>
        <li>Meals with business partners, vendors, or contractors</li>
        <li>Meals during business travel (50% deductible)</li>
        <li>Meals at business conventions or conferences</li>
        <li>Meals provided to employees for the convenience of the employer (50%)</li>
        <li>Food and beverages at a business meeting you host</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What does not qualify</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Your own lunch when eating alone (unless traveling for business)</li>
        <li>Lavish or extravagant meals (subjective, but the IRS can challenge)</li>
        <li>Meals with no business discussion or purpose</li>
        <li>Entertainment expenses (golf, concerts, sporting events — not deductible since 2018)</li>
        <li>Grocery shopping for personal consumption</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to calculate the deduction</h2>
      <p>Track the total cost of each qualifying business meal (including tax and tip). Deduct 50% of the total. For example, if you spend $80 on a client dinner (including tax and tip), your deduction is $40. Over a year, if you spend $3,000 on qualifying business meals, your deduction is $1,500.</p>

      <h2>Documentation you need</h2>
      <div class="checklist">
        <h3>Keep these records</h3>
        <div class="checklist-item">The amount spent (including tax and tip)</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">The date of the meal</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">The place (restaurant name and location)</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">The business purpose (what was discussed)</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">The names and business relationships of everyone present</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">A receipt for any meal over $75 (recommended for all meals)</div>
      </div>

      <h2>Common mistakes to avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Not documenting the business purpose of the meal</li>
        <li>Trying to deduct entertainment expenses as meals (golf outings, concerts)</li>
        <li>Assuming the 100% restaurant deduction still applies (it expired after 2022)</li>
        <li>Not keeping receipts (especially for meals over $75)</li>
        <li>Deducting personal meals that happen to be near a business location</li>
        <li>Forgetting to deduct tips and tax as part of the meal cost</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="warning-box">
        <strong>IRS audit note:</strong> Meals are a commonly audited deduction. The IRS looks for documentation of business purpose and attendees. A receipt alone is not enough — you need notes on who was there and what was discussed. Write it on the back of the receipt or log it in your accounting software immediately.

      <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
      <h3>Can I deduct meals when I eat alone?</h3>
      <p>Only if you are traveling away from home for business. Your solo meals during business travel are 50% deductible. Solo meals at your regular place of business are not deductible.</p>

      <h3>Is the 100% restaurant meal deduction still available?</h3>
      <p>No. The 100% deduction for meals at restaurants was a temporary provision for 2021 and 2022 only. As of 2023 and beyond, the standard 50% deduction applies.</p>

      <h3>Can I deduct alcohol at a business meal?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Alcoholic beverages are included in the 50% meals deduction as long as the meal itself qualifies as a business meal. The entire bill (food, drinks, tax, tip) is subject to the 50% limit.</p>
