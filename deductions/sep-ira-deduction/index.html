      <h1>SEP IRA Deduction: Contribution Limits and Rules for Self-Employed (2026)</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">Last updated: February 2026 &middot; Applies to: Self-employed individuals, freelancers, sole proprietors, small business owners</p>

      <p>A SEP IRA (Simplified Employee Pension Individual Retirement Account) is one of the most powerful tax-saving tools available to self-employed individuals. It allows you to contribute up to 25% of your net self-employment income — up to $70,000 in 2025 — and deduct the entire contribution from your taxable income. It is easy to set up, has no annual filing requirements, and contributions are flexible from year to year.</p>

      <h2>Quick summary</h2>
      <div class="info-box"><strong>Contribute up to 25% of net self-employment income, maximum $70,000 (2025 limit).</strong> Contributions are fully tax-deductible. No annual filing requirements. You can open and fund a SEP IRA up until your tax filing deadline (including extensions).</div>

      <h2>How the SEP IRA works</h2>
      <p>A SEP IRA is a retirement account that lets self-employed individuals make tax-deductible contributions based on their income. The contribution limit is 25% of net self-employment earnings (after the deduction for self-employment tax). Contributions reduce your taxable income dollar-for-dollar. The money grows tax-deferred until withdrawal in retirement. You can open and fund a SEP IRA as late as your tax filing deadline, including extensions — meaning you can make a 2025 contribution as late as October 15, 2026 if you file an extension.</p>

      <h2>What qualifies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Contributions up to 25% of net self-employment income</li>
        <li>Maximum contribution of $70,000 (2025) or $69,000 (2024)</li>
        <li>Contributions made by the tax filing deadline (including extensions)</li>
        <li>Employer contributions (if you have employees, you must contribute equally for them)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What does not qualify</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Contributions exceeding 25% of net self-employment income</li>
        <li>Contributions exceeding the annual dollar limit</li>
        <li>Employee elective deferrals (SEP IRAs are employer-contribution only)</li>
        <li>Roth contributions (SEP IRAs are traditional/pre-tax only)</li>
        <li>Catch-up contributions (SEP IRAs do not have catch-up provisions)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to calculate your maximum contribution</h2>
      <p>The calculation for self-employed individuals is slightly different from the 25% rule for employees. For sole proprietors: (1) Start with net self-employment income (Schedule C profit minus half of self-employment tax). (2) Multiply by 20% (not 25% — the effective rate is lower for sole proprietors due to the way the deduction interacts with self-employment income). The result is your maximum contribution. Example: $100,000 net Schedule C profit → roughly $18,587 maximum SEP IRA contribution after the self-employment tax adjustment.</p>

      <h2>Documentation you need</h2>
      <div class="checklist">
        <h3>Keep these records</h3>
        <div class="checklist-item">SEP IRA plan document (provided by your brokerage when you open the account)</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Records of contributions made each year</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Schedule C showing net self-employment income</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Proof of deposit dates (contributions must be made by filing deadline)</div>
      </div>

      <h2>Common mistakes to avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Contributing more than the allowable limit (the effective rate for sole proprietors is about 20%, not 25%)</li>
        <li>Missing the contribution deadline (must be made by tax filing deadline including extensions)</li>
        <li>Not knowing that if you have employees, you must contribute the same percentage for them</li>
        <li>Confusing SEP IRA with SIMPLE IRA or Solo 401(k) — different rules and limits</li>
        <li>Forgetting to actually deduct the contribution on your tax return (Schedule 1, Line 16)</li>
      </ul>

        <strong>IRS audit note:</strong> SEP IRA contributions are straightforward and not a high-audit-risk item. The main risks are exceeding the contribution limit or failing to contribute for eligible employees. Keep records of your calculation and contribution dates.

      <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
      <h3>SEP IRA vs Solo 401(k) — which is better?</h3>
      <p>A Solo 401(k) allows both employer and employee contributions, which can result in a higher total contribution at lower income levels. A SEP IRA is simpler to set up and administer. At higher income levels (above ~$200k), the maximums converge. If you want Roth contributions or loan provisions, the Solo 401(k) is the only option.</p>

      <h3>Can I open a SEP IRA after the tax year ends?</h3>
      <p>Yes. You can open and fund a SEP IRA up until your tax filing deadline, including extensions. This means you can make your 2025 contribution as late as October 15, 2026 if you file an extension.</p>

      <h3>Do I have to contribute every year?</h3>
      <p>No. SEP IRA contributions are flexible — you can contribute different amounts each year or skip years entirely. There is no minimum annual contribution requirement.</p>
