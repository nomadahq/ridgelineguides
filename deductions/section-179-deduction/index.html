      <h1>Section 179 Deduction: Write Off Equipment in the First Year (2026)</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">Last updated: February 2026 &middot; Applies to: Self-employed individuals, small business owners, any business purchasing equipment</p>

      <p>Section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code allows businesses to deduct the full purchase price of qualifying equipment and software in the year it is purchased, rather than depreciating it over several years. For small businesses, this can be a powerful way to reduce your tax bill in a year when you make significant purchases.</p>

      <h2>Quick summary</h2>
      <div class="info-box"><strong>Deduct up to $1,250,000 in qualifying equipment purchases in the year bought</strong> (2025 limit — adjusted annually for inflation). This applies to new and used equipment, software, and certain vehicles. The deduction begins to phase out when total equipment purchases exceed $3,130,000.</div>

      <h2>How Section 179 works</h2>
      <p>Normally, when you buy business equipment, you depreciate the cost over its useful life (3-7 years for most assets). Section 179 lets you skip the depreciation schedule and deduct the entire cost in Year 1. The equipment must be purchased and placed in service during the tax year. It must be used for business purposes more than 50% of the time.</p>

      <h2>What qualifies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Computers, laptops, and tablets</li>
        <li>Office furniture (desks, chairs, shelving)</li>
        <li>Machinery and manufacturing equipment</li>
        <li>Business vehicles (with limitations for passenger vehicles)</li>
        <li>Off-the-shelf software</li>
        <li>Phone systems</li>
        <li>Security systems</li>
        <li>HVAC systems for commercial buildings</li>
        <li>Certain building improvements (roofs, fire suppression, alarm systems)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What does not qualify</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Real property (land and most buildings)</li>
        <li>Property used outside the US</li>
        <li>Property acquired from related parties</li>
        <li>Property used 50% or less for business</li>
        <li>Inventory or stock for sale</li>
        <li>Air conditioning and heating units for residential rental property</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to calculate the deduction</h2>
      <p>The Section 179 deduction is straightforward: deduct the full purchase price of qualifying equipment up to the annual limit ($1,250,000 for 2025). The deduction cannot exceed your taxable business income for the year — you cannot create a loss with Section 179. Any amount that exceeds your income can be carried forward to future years.<br><br>For passenger vehicles, there is a separate cap. For SUVs over 6,000 pounds GVWR, the Section 179 deduction is limited to $30,500 (2025 limit). Vehicles under 6,000 pounds have a lower first-year depreciation limit.</p>

      <h2>Documentation you need</h2>
      <div class="checklist">
        <h3>Keep these records</h3>
        <div class="checklist-item">Purchase receipts or invoices for all equipment</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Date the equipment was placed in service</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Business-use percentage if equipment is used for both business and personal</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">IRS Form 4562 (Depreciation and Amortization)</div>
      </div>

      <h2>Common mistakes to avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Assuming Section 179 applies to all vehicles without limits (SUV and passenger car caps apply)</li>
        <li>Trying to create a business loss with Section 179 (the deduction is limited to taxable income)</li>
        <li>Not placing equipment in service during the tax year (buying in December but not using until January)</li>
        <li>Forgetting that used equipment qualifies (not just new)</li>
        <li>Not keeping records of when equipment was placed in service</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="warning-box">
        <strong>IRS audit note:</strong> Section 179 deductions for vehicles are frequently audited, especially when the vehicle is also used personally. Keep detailed records of business-use percentage and be prepared to justify the business need for the equipment.

      <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
      <h3>Can I use Section 179 on a used vehicle?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Section 179 applies to both new and used equipment, including vehicles, as long as it is new to your business and was purchased (not leased) during the tax year.</p>

      <h3>What is the difference between Section 179 and bonus depreciation?</h3>
      <p>Both allow accelerated deduction of equipment costs. Section 179 has an annual dollar limit but lets you choose which assets to expense. Bonus depreciation has no dollar limit but applies automatically to all qualifying assets. They can be used together.</p>

      <h3>Can I use Section 179 as a sole proprietor?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Section 179 is available to any business entity, including sole proprietors filing Schedule C, S-corps, partnerships, and C-corps.</p>
