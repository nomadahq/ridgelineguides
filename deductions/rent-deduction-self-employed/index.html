      <h1>Rent Deduction for Self-Employed: What You Can Write Off (2026)</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">Last updated: February 2026 &middot; Applies to: Self-employed individuals who rent office or workspace</p>

      <p>If you rent a dedicated office, coworking space, studio, or workshop for your business, the full rent is deductible as a business expense on Schedule C. If you work from home, you may be able to deduct a portion of your home rent through the home office deduction instead. This guide covers both scenarios.</p>

      <h2>Quick summary</h2>
      <div class="info-box"><strong>Rent for a dedicated business space is 100% deductible on Schedule C.</strong> Rent for a home office is deductible through the home office deduction (regular or simplified method). The key distinction is whether the space is used exclusively for business.</div>

      <h2>How the rent deduction works</h2>
      <p>Business rent is one of the most straightforward deductions. If you rent a space exclusively for business — an office, studio, warehouse, coworking desk — the full rent amount is deductible on Schedule C, Line 20b. If you work from home, the home office deduction (Form 8829) lets you deduct the business-use portion of your home rent.</p>

      <h2>What qualifies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Rent for a dedicated office or workspace</li>
        <li>Coworking space membership</li>
        <li>Studio or workshop rent</li>
        <li>Warehouse or storage facility rent</li>
        <li>Business portion of home rent (via home office deduction)</li>
        <li>Parking space rent for business vehicles</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What does not qualify</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Full home rent (only the business-use portion via home office deduction)</li>
        <li>Rent for a space used for both personal and business purposes without meeting the exclusive use test</li>
        <li>Security deposits (these are not expenses, they are assets)</li>
        <li>Rent prepaid for future years (deductible only in the year the rent applies to)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to calculate</h2>
      <p>For a dedicated business space: deduct 100% of rent paid. For home office: use the simplified method (\/sq ft, max 300 sq ft = \,500) or the regular method (business-use percentage of total rent). Example: \,000/month rent, 150 sq ft office in 1,200 sq ft apartment = 12.5% business use = (/month = \,000/year deduction.</p>

      <h2>Documentation you need</h2>
      <div class="checklist">
        <h3>Keep these records</h3>
        <div class="checklist-item">Lease agreement</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Rent payment receipts or bank statements</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">For home office: measurements and photos of dedicated space</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Form 8829 if using regular home office method</div>
      </div>

      <h2>Common mistakes to avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Deducting full home rent instead of only the business-use portion</li>
        <li>Not keeping the lease agreement on file</li>
        <li>Forgetting to deduct coworking space fees</li>
        <li>Claiming a home office that fails the exclusive use test</li>
      </ul>

        <strong>IRS audit note:</strong> Dedicated business rent is a low-audit-risk deduction. Home office rent deductions are more scrutinized — keep photos and measurements.
