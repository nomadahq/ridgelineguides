      <h1>Business Travel Deduction: What Counts and What Doesn't (2026)</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">Last updated: February 2026 &middot; Applies to: Self-employed individuals, freelancers, small business owners who travel for work</p>

      <p>When you travel away from your tax home for business, many of your travel expenses are deductible — including airfare, hotels, rental cars, and meals. But the rules around what qualifies as "business travel" versus a personal trip are specific. This guide covers what counts, what does not, and how to document everything properly.</p>

      <h2>Quick summary</h2>
      <div class="info-box"><strong>Travel expenses are deductible when you travel away from your tax home overnight for business.</strong> Deductible costs include transportation, lodging, meals (50%), and incidental expenses. The trip must have a primary business purpose. Mixed business/personal trips require allocation.</div>

      <h2>How the business travel deduction works</h2>
      <p>To deduct travel expenses, your trip must take you away from your tax home (the city or area where your main place of business is located) and require you to sleep or rest overnight. Day trips do not qualify as travel — though transportation costs for day trips may still be deductible as local business transportation. The primary purpose of the trip must be business. If a trip is primarily personal with some business activities, the transportation costs are not deductible (but specific business expenses during the trip may still be).</p>

      <h2>What qualifies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Airfare, train fare, or bus fare to and from business destination</li>
        <li>Hotel or lodging costs</li>
        <li>Rental car or taxi/rideshare costs</li>
        <li>Meals while traveling (50% deductible)</li>
        <li>Tips related to deductible expenses</li>
        <li>Dry cleaning and laundry during the trip</li>
        <li>Business calls and internet costs while traveling</li>
        <li>Baggage fees</li>
        <li>Conference or event registration fees</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What does not qualify</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Travel that is primarily personal (even with some business activities)</li>
        <li>Commuting between your home and regular workplace</li>
        <li>Lavish or extravagant expenses</li>
        <li>Travel for investment purposes (attending shareholder meetings)</li>
        <li>Spouse or family travel expenses (unless they have a bona fide business purpose)</li>
        <li>Costs that would have been incurred whether or not you traveled (your regular meals at home)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to calculate the deduction</h2>
      <p>Track all qualifying travel expenses. Transportation (airfare, car rental) and lodging are 100% deductible. Meals are 50% deductible. You can either track actual expenses or use the IRS per diem rates for lodging and meals. The per diem method simplifies record-keeping — you deduct a fixed daily amount based on the destination city instead of tracking every receipt.<br><br>For mixed business/personal trips: If the primary purpose is business, you can deduct transportation costs in full. Allocate lodging and meal costs between business and personal days. For example, a 5-day trip with 3 business days and 2 personal days: deduct 100% of airfare (primary purpose is business), 3/5 of hotel costs, and meals only for business days.</p>

      <h2>Documentation you need</h2>
      <div class="checklist">
        <h3>Keep these records</h3>
        <div class="checklist-item">Receipts for all travel expenses (airfare, hotel, meals, transport)</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">A travel log with dates, destinations, and business purpose for each trip</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Meeting agendas, conference schedules, or client correspondence proving business purpose</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Records of business activities conducted during the trip</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Per diem rate documentation if using that method</div>
      </div>

      <h2>Common mistakes to avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Not documenting the business purpose of the trip</li>
        <li>Deducting an entire mixed trip as business travel</li>
        <li>Forgetting the overnight requirement (day trips are not "travel")</li>
        <li>Not keeping receipts for expenses over $75</li>
        <li>Deducting spouse or family travel without a legitimate business reason</li>
        <li>Claiming lavish hotel upgrades or first-class flights without justification</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="warning-box">
        <strong>IRS audit note:</strong> Business travel is a commonly audited area, especially for trips to desirable destinations (Las Vegas, Hawaii, resort areas). The IRS looks for proof that the trip had a genuine business purpose. Keep meeting notes, client emails, and conference materials.

      <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
      <h3>What if my trip is half business and half vacation?</h3>
      <p>If the primary purpose is business, transportation costs (airfare) are fully deductible. Hotel and meal costs are only deductible for business days. If the primary purpose is personal, no transportation costs are deductible, but you can still deduct specific business expenses incurred during business days.</p>

      <h3>Can I deduct travel to a conference?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Conference travel is one of the clearest business travel deductions. Deduct transportation, lodging, meals (50%), and registration fees. Keep the conference agenda and any materials as documentation.</p>

      <h3>What are per diem rates?</h3>
      <p>Per diem rates are IRS-approved daily allowances for lodging and meals when traveling. They vary by city and are updated annually. Using per diem simplifies record-keeping — you deduct the set rate instead of tracking every receipt. Check the GSA per diem lookup tool for current rates.</p>
