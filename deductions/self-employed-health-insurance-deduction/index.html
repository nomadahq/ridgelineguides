      <h1>Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction: How It Works (2026)</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">Last updated: February 2026 &middot; Applies to: Self-employed individuals, sole proprietors, partners, S-corp shareholders owning >2%</p>

      <p>If you are self-employed and pay for your own health insurance, you may be able to deduct 100% of your premiums. This is an above-the-line deduction, meaning it reduces your adjusted gross income (AGI) even if you do not itemize. For many self-employed individuals, this is one of the largest deductions available.</p>

      <h2>Quick summary</h2>
      <div class="info-box"><strong>Deduct 100% of health insurance premiums</strong> for yourself, your spouse, and your dependents. This is an above-the-line deduction (Line 17 of Schedule 1) — it reduces your AGI regardless of whether you itemize. You cannot claim this deduction for any month you were eligible for an employer-sponsored plan.</div>

      <h2>How the deduction works</h2>
      <p>The self-employed health insurance deduction allows you to deduct premiums paid for medical, dental, and vision insurance for yourself, your spouse, and your dependents. The deduction is taken on Schedule 1, Line 17 of your personal tax return. It reduces your AGI, which can also lower your eligibility thresholds for other deductions and credits. The deduction cannot exceed your net self-employment income for the year.</p>

      <h2>What qualifies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Health insurance premiums (medical, dental, vision)</li>
        <li>Premiums for your spouse and dependents</li>
        <li>Long-term care insurance premiums (age-based limits apply)</li>
        <li>Medicare premiums (Parts A, B, C, and D) if you are self-employed</li>
        <li>COBRA premiums if you are self-employed during the coverage period</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What does not qualify</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Premiums for any month you were eligible to participate in an employer-sponsored plan (yours or your spouse's)</li>
        <li>Premiums that exceed your net self-employment income</li>
        <li>Premiums paid with pre-tax dollars or premium tax credits</li>
        <li>Health insurance premiums if you are a W-2 employee (even with a side business, restrictions apply)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to calculate the deduction</h2>
      <p>Add up all qualifying health insurance premiums paid during the year for yourself, your spouse, and your dependents. The deduction is the lesser of: (a) total premiums paid, or (b) your net self-employment income. For example, if you paid $12,000 in premiums and your net self-employment income was $80,000, you can deduct the full $12,000. If your net self-employment income was only $10,000, your deduction is capped at $10,000.</p>

      <h2>Documentation you need</h2>
      <div class="checklist">
        <h3>Keep these records</h3>
        <div class="checklist-item">Insurance premium statements (Form 1095-A, 1095-B, or 1095-C)</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Proof of payment (bank statements, cancelled checks)</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Records showing you were not eligible for an employer-sponsored plan</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Schedule C showing net self-employment income</div>
      </div>

      <h2>Common mistakes to avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Claiming the deduction for months when you were eligible for an employer plan</li>
        <li>Double-dipping by also claiming premiums as an itemized medical expense</li>
        <li>Forgetting to deduct dental and vision premiums (not just medical)</li>
        <li>Not deducting Medicare premiums (many self-employed individuals miss this)</li>
        <li>Claiming more than net self-employment income allows</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="warning-box">
        <strong>IRS audit note:</strong> This deduction is generally straightforward and not a high-audit-risk item. The main trigger is claiming the deduction while eligible for an employer-sponsored plan. Keep your insurance statements and proof of self-employment income.

      <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
      <h3>Can I take this deduction if my spouse has an employer plan?</h3>
      <p>If you are eligible to participate in your spouse's employer-sponsored plan, you cannot claim the self-employed health insurance deduction for those months — even if you choose not to enroll. "Eligible" is the key word, not "enrolled."</p>

      <h3>Does this reduce my self-employment tax?</h3>
      <p>No. The self-employed health insurance deduction reduces your income tax but does not reduce your self-employment tax (Social Security and Medicare). It is an income tax deduction, not a business expense on Schedule C.</p>

      <h3>Can I deduct health insurance for my employees?</h3>
      <p>Yes, but that is a different deduction. Employee health insurance premiums are a business expense deducted on Schedule C, not the self-employed health insurance deduction on Schedule 1.</p>
