      <h1>Mileage Deduction: Standard Rate vs Actual Expenses (2026)</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">Last updated: February 2026 &middot; Applies to: Self-employed individuals, freelancers, sole proprietors who use a vehicle for business</p>

      <p>If you use your personal vehicle for business purposes, you can deduct the cost. The IRS gives you two options: the standard mileage rate (a flat per-mile deduction) or the actual expense method (deducting real costs like gas, insurance, and depreciation). This guide explains both methods and helps you determine which saves you more money.</p>

      <h2>Quick summary</h2>
      <div class="info-box"><strong>2025 standard mileage rate: 70 cents per mile</strong> (2026 rate typically announced in December — check IRS.gov for the current rate). You must track every business mile driven. Commuting miles between home and a regular workplace do not count.</div>

      <h2>How the mileage deduction works</h2>
      <p>You can deduct miles driven for business purposes including travel to client sites, meetings, the bank, the post office, or anywhere you need to go for your business. You cannot deduct commuting miles (driving from home to your regular office). If you use the standard mileage rate, multiply your business miles by the IRS rate. If you use actual expenses, track all vehicle costs and multiply by your business-use percentage.</p>

      <h2>What qualifies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Driving to meet clients or customers</li>
        <li>Driving between work locations</li>
        <li>Driving to the bank, post office, or supply store for business</li>
        <li>Driving to business conferences, events, or training</li>
        <li>Driving to a temporary work location</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What does not qualify</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Commuting from home to your regular office or workplace</li>
        <li>Personal errands combined with business trips (only the business portion counts)</li>
        <li>Driving to get lunch during the workday (personal)</li>
        <li>Driving to a job interview (this is a personal expense)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Standard mileage rate vs actual expenses</h2>
      <p><strong>Standard mileage rate:</strong> Multiply business miles by the IRS rate (70 cents/mile for 2025). Example: 10,000 business miles x $0.70 = $7,000 deduction. Simple, but you cannot also deduct gas, insurance, or depreciation separately.<br><br><strong>Actual expense method:</strong> Add up all vehicle expenses (gas, oil, tires, insurance, registration, repairs, depreciation, lease payments). Multiply the total by your business-use percentage. Example: $12,000 total vehicle costs x 60% business use = $7,200 deduction. Requires more record-keeping but can yield a larger deduction for expensive vehicles or high-cost areas.<br><br><strong>Which is better?</strong> If you drive an older, fuel-efficient car, the standard rate usually wins. If you drive a newer, expensive vehicle, actual expenses may win. Calculate both and use the larger number.</p>

      <h2>Documentation you need</h2>
      <div class="checklist">
        <h3>Keep these records</h3>
        <div class="checklist-item">A mileage log with date, destination, business purpose, and miles for each trip</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Odometer readings at the start and end of the year</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Gas receipts, repair receipts, insurance statements (if using actual expense method)</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">A consistent method — you must use the same method for the entire year</div>
      </div>

      <h2>Common mistakes to avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Not keeping a mileage log (the IRS requires contemporaneous records)</li>
        <li>Including commuting miles as business miles</li>
        <li>Switching between methods mid-year (you must pick one for the whole year)</li>
        <li>Claiming 100% business use when the vehicle is also used personally</li>
        <li>Not recording odometer readings at year start and end</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="warning-box">
        <strong>IRS audit note:</strong> The IRS frequently audits mileage deductions. A mileage log is essential — without one, the entire deduction can be disallowed. Apps like MileIQ, Everlance, or Hurdlr can automate tracking.

      <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
      <h3>Can I switch between standard and actual expense methods each year?</h3>
      <p>You can switch from standard to actual in a later year, but once you use actual expenses for a vehicle, you generally cannot switch back to the standard rate for that same vehicle. Use the standard rate in the first year you use the vehicle for business if you want flexibility.</p>

      <h3>What if I use my car 50% for business and 50% for personal?</h3>
      <p>You deduct 50% of your expenses (actual method) or only the business miles (standard method). The key is accurately tracking the business versus personal split.</p>

      <h3>Do I need to track every single trip?</h3>
      <p>Yes. The IRS requires contemporaneous records — meaning you log trips as they happen, not at the end of the year from memory. Use a mileage tracking app to make this painless.</p>
