      <h1>Home Office Deduction: Who Qualifies and How to Calculate It (2026)</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">Last updated: February 2026 &middot; Applies to: Self-employed individuals, freelancers, sole proprietors filing Schedule C</p>

      <p>The home office deduction allows self-employed individuals to deduct expenses related to the business use of their home. This includes a portion of rent or mortgage interest, utilities, insurance, and other costs. It is one of the most valuable deductions available to freelancers and sole proprietors — but also one of the most misunderstood.</p>

      <h2>Quick summary</h2>
      <div class="info-box"><strong>Two methods:</strong> The simplified method gives you $5 per square foot (max 300 sq ft = $1,500). The regular method deducts actual expenses based on the percentage of your home used for business. You must use the space <strong>regularly and exclusively</strong> for business to qualify.</div>

      <h2>How the home office deduction works</h2>
      <p>To claim the home office deduction, you must use a specific area of your home regularly and exclusively for business. "Regularly" means you use it consistently (not occasionally). "Exclusively" means the space is used only for business — not also as a guest room, playroom, or general living area. If you meet both requirements, you can deduct a portion of your home expenses proportional to the business-use area.</p>

      <h2>What qualifies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Rent or mortgage interest (proportional to business-use area)</li>
        <li>Utilities (electricity, gas, water, internet)</li>
        <li>Homeowners or renters insurance</li>
        <li>Repairs and maintenance to the home</li>
        <li>Property taxes (proportional)</li>
        <li>Depreciation of the home (regular method only)</li>
        <li>HOA fees (proportional)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What does not qualify</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The full rent or mortgage — only the business-use portion</li>
        <li>Lawn care or landscaping (unless home office has separate entrance)</li>
        <li>Furniture or improvements to non-office areas</li>
        <li>A space used partly for personal purposes (fails the exclusive use test)</li>
        <li>W-2 employees working from home (this deduction is for self-employed only)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to calculate it</h2>
      <p><strong>Simplified method:</strong> Multiply the square footage of your office (max 300 sq ft) by $5. Maximum deduction: $1,500. No depreciation calculation needed. This method is easier but often results in a smaller deduction.<br><br><strong>Regular method:</strong> Divide the square footage of your office by the total square footage of your home. This gives you the business-use percentage. Apply that percentage to your total home expenses (rent, utilities, insurance, etc.). For example, if your office is 200 sq ft in a 1,600 sq ft home, your business-use percentage is 12.5%. If your total home expenses are $24,000/year, your deduction is $3,000.</p>

      <h2>Documentation you need</h2>
      <div class="checklist">
        <h3>Keep these records</h3>
        <div class="checklist-item">Measurements of your office space and total home</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Photos of the dedicated office space</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">All home expense receipts (rent, utilities, insurance)</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">A log of business use (dates and hours, if possible)</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Form 8829 (Expenses for Business Use of Your Home) if using the regular method</div>
      </div>

      <h2>Common mistakes to avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Claiming a space that is not exclusively used for business (the most common audit trigger)</li>
        <li>Using the simplified method when the regular method would give a larger deduction</li>
        <li>Forgetting to include all eligible expenses (insurance, repairs, HOA fees)</li>
        <li>W-2 employees claiming this deduction (no longer allowed after 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act)</li>
        <li>Not keeping documentation or photos of the office space</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="warning-box">
        <strong>IRS audit note:</strong> The home office deduction is one of the most audited deductions for self-employed individuals. The key is the exclusive use requirement — if you use the space for anything personal, the entire deduction can be disallowed. Keep photos and measurements on file.

      <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
      <h3>Can I claim the home office deduction if I also work at a coworking space?</h3>
      <p>Yes, as long as your home office meets the regular and exclusive use test. Having another workspace does not disqualify you, but the home office must still be your principal place of business or a place where you regularly meet clients.</p>

      <h3>What if I rent and my name is on the lease?</h3>
      <p>You can deduct the business-use portion of your rent. You do not need to own the home to claim the deduction.</p>

      <h3>Should I use the simplified or regular method?</h3>
      <p>Calculate both and use whichever gives you the larger deduction. The regular method usually wins for larger offices or higher-cost areas. The simplified method is best if you want minimal record-keeping and have a small office.</p>
