      <h1>Business Insurance Deduction: What Premiums Are Deductible? (2026)</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">Last updated: February 2026 &middot; Applies to: Self-employed individuals and small business owners</p>

      <p>Business insurance premiums are deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses on Schedule C. This includes general liability, professional liability (E&O), property insurance, business interruption insurance, and more. If you pay for insurance to protect your business, it is almost certainly deductible.</p>

      <h2>Quick summary</h2>
      <div class="info-box"><strong>All insurance premiums for business protection are deductible on Schedule C.</strong> This includes liability, professional, property, cyber, and business vehicle insurance. Health insurance for self-employed individuals has a separate, specific deduction (Schedule 1, not Schedule C).</div>

      <h2>How the deduction works</h2>
      <p>Business insurance premiums are deducted as ordinary business expenses on Schedule C, Line 15. The insurance must be for business purposes — personal insurance is not deductible here. If a policy covers both business and personal use (like a vehicle), deduct only the business-use portion.</p>

      <h2>What qualifies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>General liability insurance</li>
        <li>Professional liability / Errors & Omissions (E&O)</li>
        <li>Business property insurance</li>
        <li>Business interruption insurance</li>
        <li>Cyber liability insurance</li>
        <li>Commercial auto insurance (business-use portion)</li>
        <li>Workers compensation insurance</li>
        <li>Product liability insurance</li>
        <li>Directors and officers (D&O) insurance</li>
        <li>Business umbrella policy</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What does not qualify</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Personal health insurance (separate deduction on Schedule 1)</li>
        <li>Personal auto insurance (business portion may be deductible)</li>
        <li>Life insurance where you are the beneficiary</li>
        <li>Personal property insurance</li>
        <li>Self-insurance reserves (not deductible until actually paid)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to calculate</h2>
      <p>Add up all business insurance premiums paid during the year. For policies covering both business and personal use, apply the business-use percentage. Deduct the total on Schedule C, Line 15 (Insurance).</p>

      <h2>Documentation you need</h2>
      <div class="checklist">
        <h3>Keep these records</h3>
        <div class="checklist-item">Insurance policy documents</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Premium payment receipts or statements</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Business-use percentage for mixed-use policies</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Certificates of insurance</div>
      </div>

      <h2>Common mistakes to avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Forgetting to deduct smaller policies (cyber, professional liability)</li>
        <li>Not separating business health insurance from the general deduction (different tax treatment)</li>
        <li>Missing the deduction for workers comp premiums</li>
        <li>Not deducting the business portion of personal auto insurance</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
      <h3>Is health insurance deducted on Schedule C?</h3>
      <p>No. Self-employed health insurance is deducted on Schedule 1, Line 17 as an above-the-line deduction, not as a business expense on Schedule C. This matters because the Schedule 1 deduction reduces AGI.</p>

      <h3>Can I deduct cyber insurance?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Cyber liability insurance premiums are deductible as a business expense.</p>

      <h3>What about workers comp?</h3>
      <p>Workers compensation insurance premiums are 100% deductible as a business expense on Schedule C.</p>
