      <h1>Maryland LLC Annual Report and Personal Property Tax Return: Filing Guide (2026)</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">Last updated: February 2026 &middot; Applies to: Maryland LLCs</p>

      <p>Maryland requires every LLC to file an Annual Report / Personal Property Tax Return with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation (SDAT). This is a combined filing — it updates your LLC information and reports personal property holdings. At $300, Maryland is one of the more expensive states for LLC maintenance.</p>

      <h2>When is it due?</h2>
      <p>The Maryland annual report is due by <strong>April 15</strong> of each year. This is a universal deadline for all Maryland entities.</p>

      <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
      <p>The filing fee is $300. Late filing results in additional penalties. The fee applies regardless of whether your LLC has personal property to report.</p>

        <div class="checklist-item">Go to <a href="https://egov.maryland.gov/BusinessExpress" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Maryland Business Express</a></div>

        <div class="checklist-item">Search for your LLC and select the annual report filing</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Complete the personal property section (most small LLCs report zero)</div>

      <h2>What happens if you miss the deadline?</h2>
      <p>Failure to file by April 15 triggers penalties. Continued non-filing can result in forfeiture of your LLC charter, meaning your LLC loses its legal standing. Reinstatement requires filing all delinquent reports and paying all outstanding fees and penalties.</p>

      <h2>Do you need a registered agent in Maryland?</h2>
      <p>Yes. Maryland requires every LLC to maintain a registered agent with a physical Maryland street address.</p>

        <p>A registered agent keeps your LLC in good standing and ensures you receive all legal and state documents on time.</p>

      <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
      <h3>Why does the annual report include a personal property tax return?</h3>
      <p>Maryland combines both into a single filing. Most small service-based LLCs report no personal property, but you must still complete the form. Personal property means business equipment, furniture, and inventory — not real estate.</p>

      <h3>Is the $300 fee deductible?</h3>
      <p>Generally, yes. State filing fees are typically deductible as a business expense. Consult your tax professional.</p>

      <h3>Can I file online?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Maryland Business Express allows online filing and payment.</p>
