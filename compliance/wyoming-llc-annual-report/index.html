      <p>Wyoming LLCs must file an annual report each year. The minimum fee is $60 and is based on assets located in Wyoming. Wyoming has no state income tax, making the annual report one of the few compliance requirements.</p>

      <h2>When is it due?</h2>

      <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
      <p>The annual report fee is $60 minimum, or $60 per $250,000 of assets in Wyoming (whichever is greater). Most small LLCs pay the $60 minimum.</p>

      <h2>What happens if you miss the deadline?</h2>
      <p>A $50 late fee applies. After 60 days delinquent, the LLC may be administratively dissolved.</p>

      <h2>Do you need a registered agent in Wyoming?</h2>
      <p><strong>Yes.</strong> Wyoming requires all LLCs to maintain a registered agent with a Wyoming address. This is especially important since many Wyoming LLCs are formed by out-of-state owners.</p>

        <p><strong>Need a registered agent in Wyoming?</strong></p>
        <p>A registered agent keeps your LLC in good standing and ensures you receive all legal and state documents on time.</p>
