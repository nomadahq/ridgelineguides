      <h1>Arizona LLC Annual Report: Deadline, Cost, and Filing Guide (2026)</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">Last updated: February 2026 · Applies to: Arizona LLCs</p>

      <p>Arizona requires every LLC to file an annual report with the Arizona Corporation Commission. Like Ohio, Arizona does not charge a filing fee — the annual report is free. The report confirms your LLC's basic information and keeps it in good standing.</p>

      <h2>Quick summary</h2>

      <table>

        <tr><td>Frequency</td><td>Annual</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Due date</td><td>Within 60 days before or after the anniversary of your LLC's formation</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Filing fee</td><td>$0 (no filing fee)</td></tr>

      </table>

      <h2>When is it due?</h2>
      <p>The Arizona annual report is due within a <strong>60-day window surrounding the anniversary of your LLC's approval date</strong>. You can file starting 60 days before and must file no later than 60 days after.</p>

      <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
      <p>There is no filing fee for the Arizona LLC annual report. It is completely free to file online.</p>

      <h2>How to file</h2>

        <h3>Filing steps</h3>
        <div class="checklist-item">Go to the <a href="https://ecorp.azcc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Arizona Corporation Commission eCorp portal</a></div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Search for your LLC by name or file number</div>

      <h2>What happens if you don't file?</h2>
      <p>If you fail to file the annual report within the 60-day window, the Arizona Corporation Commission may administratively dissolve your LLC. You can apply for reinstatement by filing the delinquent report(s) and paying a reinstatement fee.</p>

      <h2>Do you need a registered agent in Arizona?</h2>
      <p>Yes. Arizona requires every LLC to maintain a statutory agent (Arizona's term for registered agent) with a physical Arizona street address.</p>
