      <h1>Nevada LLC Annual List: Deadline, Cost, and Filing Guide (2026)</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">Last updated: February 2026 &middot; Applies to: Nevada LLCs</p>

      <p>Nevada requires every LLC to file an Annual List of Managers or Managing Members with the Secretary of State, plus a separate State Business License renewal. Combined, these cost $350 per year — making Nevada more expensive than many business owners expect, despite its reputation as a tax-friendly state.</p>

      <h2>When is it due?</h2>
