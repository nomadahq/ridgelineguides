      <h1>Michigan LLC Annual Statement: Deadline, Cost, and Filing Guide (2026)</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">Last updated: February 2026 · Applies to: Michigan LLCs</p>

      <p>Michigan requires every LLC to file an annual statement with LARA (Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs). At $25, Michigan is one of the most affordable states. Michigan uses a universal February 15 deadline for all LLCs, unlike most states that use formation anniversaries.</p>

      <h2>When is it due?</h2>
      <p>The Michigan annual statement is due by <strong>February 15</strong> of each year. This is a universal deadline — all LLCs file by the same date regardless of formation month.</p>

      <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
      <p>The filing fee is $25. There is no separate late fee, but failure to file will eventually lead to administrative dissolution.</p>

      <h2>What happens if you don't file?</h2>
      <p>If you miss February 15, your LLC is not immediately dissolved. However, continued non-filing will trigger the administrative dissolution process. File as soon as possible if you miss the deadline.</p>

      <h2>Do you need a registered agent in Michigan?</h2>
      <p>Yes. Michigan requires every LLC to maintain a resident agent (Michigan's term for registered agent) with a physical Michigan street address.</p>
