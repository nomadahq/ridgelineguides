      <p class="article-meta">Last updated: February 2026 · Applies to: Colorado LLCs</p>

      <p>Colorado requires every LLC to file a periodic report with the Secretary of State. At just $10, Colorado has one of the lowest filing fees in the country. The report confirms your LLC's current information.</p>

      <h2>When is it due?</h2>
      <p>The Colorado periodic report is due during a <strong>3-month window</strong> that begins in your LLC's anniversary month. For example, if formed in March, your window runs March 1 through May 31.</p>

      <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
      <p>The filing fee is $10, making Colorado one of the most affordable states for LLC maintenance.</p>
