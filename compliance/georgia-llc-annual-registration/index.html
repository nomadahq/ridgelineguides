      <h1>Georgia LLC Annual Registration: Deadline, Cost, and Filing Guide (2026)</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">Last updated: February 2026 · Applies to: Georgia domestic and foreign LLCs</p>

      <p>Georgia requires every LLC to file an annual registration with the Georgia Secretary of State. This filing confirms your LLC's basic information and keeps it in good standing with the state. The process is straightforward, costs $50, and can be completed online in a few minutes.</p>

      <h2>What is the Georgia annual registration?</h2>

      <p>The annual registration is a required filing that updates the Georgia Secretary of State on your LLC's current information. It confirms or updates:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Principal office address</li>
        <li>Registered agent name and address</li>
        <li>Names of managers or members (depending on management structure)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>It does not require financial details or tax information. It is purely an informational filing.</p>

      <h2>When is it due?</h2>

      <p>The Georgia annual registration must be filed <strong>between January 1 and April 1</strong> of each year. Unlike some states where the deadline is tied to your formation date, Georgia uses a universal filing window for all LLCs.</p>

      <div class="info-box">
        <strong>First-year note:</strong> If your LLC was formed during the current calendar year, your first annual registration is not due until the following year's January–April window.
      </div>

      <h2>How to file</h2>

      <div class="checklist">
        <h3>Filing steps</h3>
        <div class="checklist-item">Go to the <a href="https://ecorp.sos.ga.gov/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Georgia Corporations Division online portal</a></div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Search for your LLC by name or control number</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Select "File Annual Registration"</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Review your LLC information and update any changes</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Pay the $50 filing fee by credit card</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Save your confirmation for your records</div>
      </div>

      <h2>What happens if you don't file?</h2>

      <p>If you fail to file the annual registration by April 1, the Georgia Secretary of State will administratively dissolve your LLC. Dissolution means your LLC loses its legal standing and liability protections.</p>

      <div class="warning-box">
        <strong>Georgia does not charge a separate late fee</strong> — it goes straight to administrative dissolution. This makes it especially important not to miss the April 1 deadline. If your LLC is dissolved, you can apply for reinstatement, but you will need to file all delinquent annual registrations and pay all outstanding fees.
      </div>

      <h2>Do you need a registered agent in Georgia?</h2>

      <p>Yes. Georgia requires every LLC to maintain a registered agent with a physical street address in Georgia. The registered agent receives legal documents and official correspondence on behalf of your LLC. A P.O. Box does not qualify.</p>

      <div class="cta-box">
        <p><strong>Need a registered agent in Georgia?</strong></p>
        <p>A registered agent keeps your LLC in good standing and ensures you never miss important legal notices.</p>

      <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

      <h3>Is there a grace period after April 1?</h3>
      <p>Georgia does not offer a formal grace period. If you have not filed by April 1, your LLC is subject to administrative dissolution. However, the dissolution process may not happen immediately, giving you a brief window to file late. It is not advisable to rely on this — file by April 1.</p>

      <h3>Can I file by mail?</h3>
      <p>Georgia strongly encourages electronic filing. While paper forms exist, online filing through the Secretary of State's portal is faster and provides immediate confirmation.</p>

      <h3>What is the difference between the annual registration and Georgia taxes?</h3>
      <p>The annual registration ($50) is an informational filing with the Secretary of State. Georgia state taxes are filed separately with the Georgia Department of Revenue. Both are required. The annual registration keeps your LLC in good standing; taxes satisfy your tax obligations.</p>
