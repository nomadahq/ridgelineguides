      <h1>Virginia LLC Annual Registration Fee: Deadline, Cost, and Filing Guide (2026)</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">Last updated: February 2026 · Applies to: Virginia LLCs</p>

      <p>Virginia requires every LLC to pay an annual registration fee to the State Corporation Commission (SCC). Virginia is unique in that this is technically a fee payment rather than an informational report — you pay $50 to maintain your LLC's active status. If your information has changed, you file a separate amendment.</p>

      <h2>When is it due?</h2>
      <p>The annual registration fee is due by the <strong>last day of the month in which your LLC was formed</strong>.</p>

      <p>The annual registration fee is $50. If paid late, Virginia assesses a penalty (typically 10%, or $5) plus interest.</p>

      <h2>What happens if you don't file?</h2>
