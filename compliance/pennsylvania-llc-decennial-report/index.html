      <h1>Pennsylvania LLC Decennial Report: Deadline, Cost, and Filing Guide (2026)</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">Last updated: February 2026 · Applies to: Pennsylvania LLCs</p>

      <p>Pennsylvania is unique among US states — it does not require annual reports for LLCs. Instead, Pennsylvania requires a decennial report filed every 10 years. This makes Pennsylvania one of the lowest-maintenance states for LLCs. However, the infrequent filing schedule means many LLC owners forget about it entirely.</p>

      <h2>When is it due?</h2>
      <p>The decennial report is due every 10 years, during the year that ends in the same digit as the year your LLC was formed. For example, if your LLC was formed in 2018, your first decennial report is due in 2028. The report can be filed at any point during the decennial year.</p>

      <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
      <p>The filing fee is $70. There is no late penalty, but failing to file may result in your LLC being listed as inactive in state records, which can create problems when applying for loans or entering contracts that require proof of good standing.</p>

        <h3>Filing steps</h3>
        <div class="checklist-item">Go to the <a href="https://www.dos.pa.gov/BusinessCharities/Business/RegistrationForms/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Pennsylvania Department of State website</a></div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Download or access the Decennial Report form</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Complete the form with your LLC's current information</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Submit the form and pay the $70 fee</div>
        <div class="checklist-item">Save your confirmation</div>
      </div>

      <h2>What happens if you don't file?</h2>
      <p>Pennsylvania does not dissolve LLCs for failing to file the decennial report. However, your LLC may be flagged as inactive in state records. Banks and business partners may require proof of good standing that you cannot provide without filing. It is low-cost and easy to forget but worth staying on top of.</p>

      <h2>Do you need a registered agent in Pennsylvania?</h2>
      <p>Pennsylvania uses the term "registered office" instead of registered agent. Every Pennsylvania LLC must maintain a registered office address within the state. This can be your own business address or a commercial registered agent service.</p>
