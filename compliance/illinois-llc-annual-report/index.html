      <h1>Illinois LLC Annual Report: Deadline, Cost, and Filing Guide (2026)</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">Last updated: February 2026 · Applies to: Illinois LLCs</p>

      <p>Illinois requires every LLC to file an annual report with the Secretary of State. The report confirms your LLC's current information and keeps it in good standing. Illinois uses your LLC's formation anniversary month as the due date, not a fixed calendar date. The fee was reduced from $250 to $75 in 2024.</p>
