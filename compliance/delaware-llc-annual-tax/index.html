      <h1>Delaware LLC Annual Tax: Deadline, Cost, and Filing Guide (2026)</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">Last updated: February 2026 &middot; Applies to: Delaware LLCs</p>

      <p>Delaware LLCs must pay an annual tax of $300 by June 1 each year. There is no annual report required for LLCs in Delaware — just the tax payment. Delaware is popular for formations, but the $300 annual tax applies to all domestic LLCs regardless of activity.</p>

      <h2>When is it due?</h2>
      <p>The annual tax is due <strong>June 1 each year</strong>. There is no report to file — just a payment.</p>

      <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
      <p>The annual tax is a flat $300 for all LLCs. Late payment incurs a $200 penalty plus 1.5% monthly interest on the unpaid amount.</p>

      <h2>How to file</h2>

      <h2>What happens if you miss the deadline?</h2>
      <p>Late payment results in a $200 penalty plus 1.5% monthly interest. Non-payment leads to forfeiture of good standing and potential voiding of the LLC.</p>

      <h2>Do you need a registered agent in Delaware?</h2>
      <p><strong>Yes.</strong> Delaware requires all LLCs to maintain a registered agent with a physical address in Delaware. This is especially important since most Delaware LLCs do not operate in Delaware.</p>

        <p><strong>Need a registered agent in Delaware?</strong></p>
        <p>A registered agent keeps your LLC in good standing and ensures you receive all legal and state documents on time.</p>

      <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
      <h3>Do I need to file an annual report?</h3>
      <p>No. Delaware LLCs do not have an annual report. You only need to pay the $300 annual tax.</p>

      <h3>Why is Delaware so popular for LLCs?</h3>
      <p>Delaware has a well-established business court (Court of Chancery), privacy protections, and flexible LLC laws. However, the $300 annual tax applies to all LLCs.</p>

      <h3>What if my LLC has no activity?</h3>
      <p>You still owe the $300 annual tax regardless of business activity.</p>
