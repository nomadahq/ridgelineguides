      <p>Ohio requires LLCs to file a biennial report with the Ohio Secretary of State every two years. The best part: there is no filing fee. Ohio is one of the few states where this required filing is completely free.</p>

      <h2>When is it due?</h2>

      <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
      <p>There is no filing fee for the Ohio biennial report. It is completely free to file online.</p>
