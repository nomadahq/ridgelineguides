      <h1>HubSpot vs Salesforce (2026): Which CRM Is Better for Small Business?</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

      <p>HubSpot and Salesforce are the two biggest names in CRM. HubSpot offers a generous free tier and is known for ease of use. Salesforce is the enterprise standard with deep customization. For small businesses, the choice comes down to whether you need simplicity or power — and how much you are willing to spend.</p>

      <h2>Quick verdict</h2>
      <div class="info-box"><strong>Choose HubSpot</strong> if you want a free or affordable CRM with built-in marketing tools and an easy learning curve. <strong>Choose Salesforce</strong> if you need deep customization, complex sales processes, or plan to scale to a large sales team.</div>

      <h2>Who should use HubSpot CRM?</h2>
      <p>HubSpot is better for small businesses that want a CRM they can set up themselves, without hiring a consultant or admin. Its free plan is genuinely useful, and the built-in marketing tools mean you do not need separate email marketing or landing page software. Ideal for teams under 20 people with straightforward sales processes.</p>

      <h2>Who should use Salesforce?</h2>
      <p>Salesforce is better if you have a complex or unusual sales process that requires deep customization, or if you plan to scale to a large sales organization. It is also the right choice if your industry has Salesforce-specific integrations or if you need enterprise-grade reporting. Be prepared to invest in setup and potentially a part-time admin.</p>

      <h2>The bottom line</h2>
      <p>For most small businesses, HubSpot is the better starting point. It is faster to set up, easier to use, and the free plan lets you start without financial commitment. If you outgrow it or need deep customization, you can migrate to Salesforce later — though the migration is not trivial. If you know from the start that you need enterprise-grade CRM, go directly to Salesforce.</p>

      <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
      <h3>Can I switch from HubSpot to Salesforce later?</h3>
      <p>Yes, but it requires data migration and potentially rebuilding workflows. The earlier you switch, the easier it is. Both platforms have import/export tools.</p>

      <h3>Is HubSpot really free?</h3>
      <p>Yes. HubSpot CRM free plan includes contact management, deal tracking, email tracking, and basic reporting at no cost. Paid plans add automation, advanced reporting, and more marketing tools.</p>

      <h3>Do I need a Salesforce consultant?</h3>
      <p>For basic setup, you can manage on your own with Trailhead (Salesforce free training). For complex implementations, most businesses hire a Salesforce consultant or admin, which is an additional cost.</p>
