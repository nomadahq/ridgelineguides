      <h1>Gusto vs ADP (2026): Payroll Software for Small Business Compared</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

      <p>Gusto and ADP are two of the most widely used payroll services for small businesses. Gusto is a modern, tech-forward platform built specifically for small businesses. ADP is the legacy enterprise payroll provider that also offers a small business product (ADP Run). Both handle payroll, taxes, and benefits — but the experience is very different.</p>

      <h2>Quick verdict</h2>
      <div class="info-box"><strong>Choose Gusto</strong> if you are a small business that wants simple, transparent pricing and a modern interface. <strong>Choose ADP</strong> if you need a payroll provider that can scale to hundreds of employees or need specialized HR and compliance features.</div>

      <h2>Gusto: Pros and cons</h2>
      <h3>Pros</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Transparent, published pricing</li>
        <li>Modern, intuitive interface</li>
        <li>Easy self-service setup — no sales call required</li>
        <li>Full-service payroll with tax filing included</li>
        <li>Integrates well with modern accounting tools</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Cons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Less scalable for very large businesses (100+ employees)</li>
        <li>Fewer HR features than ADP at enterprise level</li>
        <li>Limited international payroll</li>
        <li>Support can be slow during peak periods (year-end)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>ADP Run: Pros and cons</h2>
      <h3>Pros</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Scales from 1 to thousands of employees</li>
        <li>Extensive HR and compliance features</li>
        <li>Dedicated support representative on higher tiers</li>
        <li>International payroll capabilities</li>
        <li>Established brand with decades of payroll experience</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Cons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>No public pricing — must request a quote</li>
        <li>Interface feels dated compared to Gusto</li>
        <li>Setup can require a sales process</li>

        <li>Upselling is aggressive</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who should use Gusto?</h2>
      <p>Gusto is better for small businesses under 100 employees that want a simple, modern payroll solution with transparent pricing. It is especially good for tech-savvy businesses, startups, and companies that value self-service setup without sales calls.</p>

      <h2>Who should use ADP Run?</h2>
      <p>ADP is better for businesses that are growing rapidly, need enterprise-grade HR features, or operate internationally. If you anticipate scaling past 100 employees or need specialized compliance support, ADP provides infrastructure that Gusto cannot match.</p>

      <h2>The bottom line</h2>
      <p>For most small businesses under 50 employees, Gusto is the better choice — it is simpler, more transparent, and easier to use. For larger or more complex organizations, ADP offers scale and depth that Gusto has not yet matched. The lack of public pricing from ADP is a legitimate frustration that pushes many small businesses toward Gusto by default.</p>

      <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
      <h3>Why does ADP not publish pricing?</h3>
      <p>ADP uses custom quoting based on company size, features needed, and contract terms. This allows them to price discriminate but makes comparison shopping difficult. Many small business owners find this frustrating.</p>

      <h3>Can I switch payroll providers mid-year?</h3>
      <p>Yes, but it requires careful timing. The best time to switch is at the beginning of a quarter. Your new provider will need year-to-date payroll data to ensure accurate tax filing.</p>

      <h3>Does Gusto handle 1099 contractors?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Gusto can pay both W-2 employees and 1099 contractors, and handles tax form generation for both.</p>
