      <h1>Mailchimp vs ConvertKit (2026): Which Email Platform Fits Your Business?</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

      <p>Mailchimp and ConvertKit are both popular email marketing platforms, but they serve different audiences. Mailchimp is a broad marketing platform with email, landing pages, social ads, and e-commerce features. ConvertKit is built specifically for creators — bloggers, podcasters, course creators, and anyone who sells digital products. This guide compares them honestly.</p>

      <h2>Who should use Mailchimp?</h2>
      <p>Mailchimp is better for e-commerce businesses, small businesses that want one platform for email, social ads, and landing pages, and anyone who values email design flexibility. It is the broader marketing platform.</p>

      <h2>Who should use ConvertKit?</h2>
      <p>ConvertKit is better for creators, bloggers, podcasters, course creators, and anyone selling digital products. Its subscriber-first model, clean automation, and built-in digital product sales make it the best choice for creator businesses.</p>

      <h2>The bottom line</h2>
      <p>If you sell physical products or need a broad marketing platform, Mailchimp is the better fit. If you are a creator who sells digital products, courses, or memberships and values clean automation, ConvertKit is purpose-built for you. Both are solid — the right choice depends on your business model, not which one is "better" in the abstract.</p>

      <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
      <h3>Which has better deliverability?</h3>
      <p>ConvertKit has a strong reputation for deliverability, partly because it encourages plain-text-style emails that perform well in inboxes. Mailchimp deliverability is good but can vary depending on your sending practices.</p>

      <h3>Can I sell products with ConvertKit?</h3>
      <p>Yes. ConvertKit has a built-in Commerce feature that lets you sell digital products, subscriptions, and courses directly — no need for a separate platform like Gumroad or Teachable.</p>

      <h3>Is Mailchimp still good for small businesses?</h3>
      <p>Yes, but it has gotten more expensive and complex over the years. For simple email needs, ConvertKit or even free alternatives may be more appropriate. Mailchimp shines when you use its full marketing suite.</p>
