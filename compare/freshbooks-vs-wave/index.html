      <h2>Who should use FreshBooks?</h2>
      <p>FreshBooks is worth paying for if invoicing is a core part of your business, you need time tracking, you work with international clients (multi-currency), or you value responsive customer support. The automation features (payment reminders, recurring invoices) can pay for themselves if they reduce your late payments.</p>

      <h2>Who should use Wave?</h2>
      <p>Wave is the right choice if you are just starting out, have a very tight budget, and need basic accounting and invoicing without paying anything. It is genuinely useful — not a stripped-down demo. If your needs are simple (track income, track expenses, send occasional invoices), Wave handles it.</p>

      <h2>The bottom line</h2>
      <p>Wave is one of the few truly free accounting tools that is actually good enough for real use. If you are bootstrapping and every dollar matters, start with Wave. If your business relies heavily on invoicing, client management, or time tracking, FreshBooks is worth the cost — the time you save and the late payments you avoid will likely exceed the subscription fee.</p>
